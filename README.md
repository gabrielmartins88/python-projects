# Python Projects

Welcome to my Python Projects! Here, I showcase a selection of projects that some of my skills in Python development, automation, data analysis, and software engineering principles. Each project is designed to illustrate my approach to solving real-world problems, applying best practices, and developing robust, maintainable code. Whether it's a complex application or a concise tool, these projects reflect my commitment to quality and innovation in Python programming.

## Overview
This portfolio includes a variety of projects ranging from automation scripts to full-stack applications and machine learning models. My focus is on:
- **Scalability**: Designing applications that are efficient and performant.
- **Code Quality**: Following clean code practices, PEP 8 standards, and writing unit tests.
- **Documentation**: Ensuring each project is well-documented and easy to understand.

## Projects

| Project | Description | Technologies |
| ------- | ----------- | ------------ |
| [Project 1: Data Analysis Pipeline](link) | A Python-based data pipeline that automates the extraction, transformation, and loading (ETL) of large datasets. Designed for scalability and error handling. | `Pandas`, `SQLAlchemy`, `Airflow` |
| [Project 2: Web Scraping Tool](link) | A web scraper that gathers data from multiple sources and organizes it in a database. Includes error handling and logging. | `BeautifulSoup`, `Requests`, `SQLite` |
| [Project 3: RESTful API](link) | A REST API built with Flask, designed to serve data and handle CRUD operations securely. | `Flask`, `SQLite`, `Docker` |
| [Project 4: Machine Learning Model](link) | A machine learning pipeline to predict user behavior. Trained and optimized a classifier for production deployment. | `Scikit-Learn`, `NumPy`, `Pandas` |

## Technologies & Skills
My projects utilize a variety of tools and libraries, demonstrating skills in:
- **Programming Languages**: Python, SQL, JavaScript (for some full-stack projects)
- **Frameworks & Libraries**: Flask, Django, Scikit-Learn, Pandas, BeautifulSoup
- **Development Practices**: Unit Testing, CI/CD, Git Version Control
- **Workflow Automation**: Experience with RPA (Robotic Process Automation) and task scheduling
